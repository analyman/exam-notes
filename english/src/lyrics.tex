Hello, Hello
Can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello
Do you meet me before I fade away.

Is this a place that I call home?
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknow
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There is a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

Hello, hello
Nice to meet you
Voices inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you
How can I forget?

Is this is place that I call home?
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknow
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There is a ghost inside me
It all belongs to other side

We live, we love, we lie
We live, we love, we lie

\blyrics{Move Your Body}
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Poetry in your Body
You got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I'm watching?
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you
Wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)
Your body's poetry speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And Let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Poetry in your body
Got me started, may it never end
Feel my rhythm in your system
This is living, I'm your only friend
Fell the beat in your chest
Beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from its cage
Free the rage like an animal

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)
Your body's poetry speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And Let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)
Your body's poetry speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And Let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
