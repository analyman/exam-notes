{\tt Clause is the smallest grammartic unit that can express a complete proposition.}
And clause is an important and hard part in english grammar, so today I spend some
time to learn and note something about clause.

The different types of clause include \emph{Main clause(independent clause)} and 
\emph{subodinate clause(dependent clause)}.
The former can express complete meaning, and the latter are those that would be
awkward or incomplete if the were alone.

\section{subodinate clause}

Firstly, we should know the kind of subodinate clause.\par
